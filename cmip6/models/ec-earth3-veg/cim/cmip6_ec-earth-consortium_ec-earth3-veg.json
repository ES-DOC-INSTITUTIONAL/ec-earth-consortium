PFTs are distinguished in terms of growth form, phenology, life history strategy, allometry, photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4), climate-dependent scaling of physiological processes and a limited set of bioclimatic limits (Smith et al., 2014).

The implementation in LPJ-GUESS is fully described by Smith-et-al-2001. Multiple PFTs are represented and may co-occur within simulated stands or grid cells. The basic structural unit is an average individual plant, whose state is defined by foliage and fine root compartments, for woody PFTs also sapwood and heartwood. Each compartment consists of a quantity of C biomass expressed on a patch ground area basis, kg C m\u22122. For woody PFTs, each average individual is associated with a cohort (age class) of individuals that are born in the same year and retain the same size and form as they grow. Stem density (indiv. m\u22122) is an additional state descriptor for a cohort in a patch. For herbaceous PFTs (\u201cgrasses\u201d) a single average individual represents the entire population of a given patch; cohorts are not distinguished and population density is not defined. For woody PFTs, height, stem diameter and crown area of individual trees (or shrubs) can be derived from the state variables, i.e. sapwood biomass and stem density, based on PFT-specific allometric constants (see Smith-et-al-2014). Patches (0.1 ha) correspond to the maximum expected area of influence, in terms of competition for light and soil resources, of a large individual tree on its neighbours. Replicate patches are simulated to account for landscape-scale heterogeneity in stand structure and composition arising from the differential disturbance histories of different patches. In a standard simulation, generic patch-destroying disturbances (representing, for example, windstorms or landslides) recur stochastically with a prescribed expected frequency, typically 0.01 yr\u22121. Wildfires are also simulated and result in partial destruction of the biomass of an affected patch. Bioclimatic limits define the environmental envelope within which PFTs are able to establish and/or survive under current climate conditions in a simulated site or grid cell. Establishment is also affected by stand structure, the density of new individuals born each year declining as crowding reduces potential forest-floor NPP below the optimum possible in the absence of standing vegetation, preempting light and soil resources. PFTs differ in terms of a suite of prescribed parameters that together define their life-history strategy. In general, shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant PFTs are distinguished. Shade-intolerant PFTs exhibit relatively dense establishment under initial, non-crowded conditions, rapid height growth, a short average life span, and poor tolerance of resource stress, the lattermost resulting in markedly increased mortality, reducing stem density and biomass, under shading or other resource-deficit-mediated stress. Shade-tolerant PFTs have lower initial establishment and slower height growth but a longer expected life span and lower mortality under shading or resource stress. Interactions between PFTs differing in life history and other characteristics greatly influence the structural and compositional evolution of stands (patches) following a disturbance; under climate conditions promoting sufficient productivity for stand closure, a classic secondary successional series, with shade-intolerant trees displacing an initial layer of grass, to be subsequently succeeded by shade-tolerant trees, typically emerges (Smith-et-al-2014)."], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.carbon_cycle.vegetation.forest_stand_dynamics"}]}, {"meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.Topic"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.carbon_cycle.litter", "properties": [{"values": ["10.0"], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.carbon_cycle.litter.number_of_carbon_pools"}, {"values": ["Per patch PFT: leaf litter, fine root litter, sapwood litter, heartwood litter.

N deposition is prescribed as monthly mean values from an external database, whereas BNF is computed prognostically based on an empirical dependency on ecosystem ET from Cleveland-et-al-1999. Among three alternatives proposed by Cleveland-et-al-1999 LPJ-GUESS chose the lower-range \u201cconservative\u201d parameterisation, with 5-year average actual evapotranspiration (AET, mm yr\u22121), prognosed by the model, as the independent variable\n\nBNF = 0.0102 \u00b7 AET + 0.524\n\nBNF is distributed equally throughout the year and added directly to the soil-available mineral N pool, Navail, which is capped at a saturation level of 2 g N m\u22122 following Parton-et-al-1993. BNF in excess of the saturation level is discarded (assumed not to have occurred). N deposition during periods of snow lie is stored in the snowpack and released to the soil in proportion to snowmelt.\n\nN is lost from the ecosystem via leaching, computed daily as the sum of leached soluble organic N and leached mineral N, and through volatilisation by wildfires. In addition, 1 % of daily N mineralisation is assumed to be lost as gaseous emissions from soils. Leaching of soluble organic N and C is computed conjointly as a fraction (LO) of the soil microbial SOM N and C pool, dependent on percolation (PH2O, mm) and soil sand fraction (TS), following  Parton-et-al-1993\n\nLO = 1.83 \u00b7 10\u22124 \u00b7 PH2O(0.01 + 0.04 \u00b7 TS).\n\nFor mineral N, the leaching fraction (LM) depends on daily percolation as a fraction of available soil water content (WTOT, mm)\n\nLM = PH2O / WTOT\n\nC and N dynamics of soils are simulated conjointly by an SOM scheme adopted from the CENTURY model (Parton-et-al-1993), with modifications by Comins-and-McMurtrie-1993 and Kirschbaum-and-Paul-2002, and updates by Parton-et-al-2010. Eleven pools differing in C:N stoichiometry and base decay rate are distinguished. Decomposition, computed daily for each pool, results in heterotrophic respiration (release of CO2) and transfer of C and N between pools, satisfying mass balance. Carbon entering the receiver pool drives N mineralisation or immobilisation. N is mineralised (added to the soil mineral N pool, Navail) when N transferred from a donor pool exceeds the corresponding increase dictated by the prescribed C:N ratio of a receiver pool (N \u201csupply\u201c exceeds \u201cdemand\u201c). Conversely, if the N flux from a donor pool is too small to satisfy the C:N ratio of the receiver pool (demand > supply), N immobilisation occurs, reducing Navail to satisfy the deficit. If Navail is insufficient to satisfy the N demand for immobilisation among all pools, decay rates are reduced proportionately so that net immobilisation matches Navail.\n\nPlants obtain N for allocation to their biomass compartments leaves, fine roots and (for woody PFTs) sapwood through root uptake from the soil mineral N pool Navail. N uptake takes place daily and is the smaller of current supply, i.e. Navail, and demand, subject to a maximum constraint on total uptake. Vegetation N demand is based on a solution of the carboxylation capacity of rubisco (Vmax) that maximises net assimilation at the canopy level given current temperature, light interception and intercellular [CO2], the latter affected by ambient [CO2] but also by the influence of soil moisture and boundary layer humidity on stomatal conductance (Haxeltine-and-Prentice-1996a, Haxeltine-and-Prentice-b; Sitch-et-al-2003). Following Haxeltine-and-Prentice-1996a, leaf N content (Nleaf, g N m\u22122) is related to Vmax (g C m\u22122) by the relationship\n\nNleaf = 2083 \u00b7 Vmax \u00b7 exp[\u22120.693 \u00b7 (T \u221225)] / L \u00b7 f(LAI) + 7.15 \u00b7 Cleaf\n\nwhere T is air temperature (\u25e6C); L is day length (s); Cleaf is leaf C mass, accounting for canopy phenology (g C m\u22122); and f(LAI) is a modifier dependent on current leaf area index (LAI, m2 m\u22122) that accounts for the empirical finding that leaf N content declines more gradually with canopy depth compared to incoming sunlight (Lloyd-et-al-2010; Peltoniemi-et-al-2012)\n\nf(LAI) = exp(0.12 \u00b7 LAI)\n\nBased on the Nleaf eqn, the target leaf C:N mass ratio may be calculated as Cleaf / Nleaf. Leaf C:N is, however, constrained to remain within prescribed boundaries [CNleaf,min, CNleaf,max] based on observations (Reich-et-al-1992; White-et-al-2000). C:N ratios for the further compartments\u2019 fine roots and (for woody PFTs) sapwood are assumed to vary proportionately with leaf C:N, fine roots maintaining a C:N ratio 1.16 times higher, and sapwood 6.9 times higher, than leaves (Friend-et-al-1997)."], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.nitrogen_cycle.overview"}, {"values": ["Vegetation dynamics are simulated in LPJ-GUESS on six stand types, five having dynamic gridcell fractions consistent with the LUH2 dataset, namely Natural, Pasture, Urban, Crop, and Irrigated Crop, and one, Peatland, having a fixed gridcell fraction."], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.nitrogen_cycle.tiling"}, {"values": ["86400.0"], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.nitrogen_cycle.time_step"}, {"values": ["fBNF_monthly, fNAnthDisturb_monthly, fNdep_monthly, fNfert_monthly, fNgas_monthly, fNgasFire_monthly, fNgasNonFire_monthly, fNLandToOcean_monthly, fNleach_monthly, fNLitterSoil_monthly, fNloss_monthly, fNnetmin_monthly, fNProduct_monthly, fNup_monthly, fNVegLitter_monthly, nLand_monthly, nLeaf_monthly, nLitter_monthly, nLitterCwd_monthly, nLitterSubSurf_monthly, nLitterSurf_monthly, nMineral_monthly, nMineralNH4_monthly, nMineralNO3_monthly, nOther_monthly, nProduct_monthly, nRoot_monthly, nSoil_monthly, nStem_monthly, nVeg_monthly, fN2O_monthly, fNOx_monthly"], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.nitrogen_cycle.prognostic_variables"}]}], "description": "Land Surface", "specializationID": "cmip6.land", "name": "Land", "meta": {"createDate": "2020-07-17 20:53:43.731243", "project": "cmip6", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "type": "cim.2.science.Realm", "id": "0e3fd95d-dd28-47ff-9f3c-64cafe915791"}, "grid": {"meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.Topic"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.grid", "properties": [{"values": ["T255"], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.grid.name"}], "subTopics": [{"meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.Topic"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.grid.horizontal", "properties": [{"values": ["True"], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.grid.horizontal.matches_atmosphere_grid"}]}]}, "keyProperties": {"meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.Topic"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.key_properties", "properties": [{"values": ["HTESSEL & LPJ-GUESS"], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.key_properties.name"}, {"values": ["Water cycle, energy balance, snow, dynamic vegetation, land cover and land use change, carbon and nitrogen cycling, crop model, permafrost carbon"], "meta": {"type": "cim.2.science.TopicProperty"}, "specializationID": "cmip6.land.key_properties.keywords"}, {"values": ["Features in this section describes updates when LPJ-GUESS is coupled to HTESSEL to handle processes LPJ-GUESS contributes with e.g. dynamic vegetation, carbon and nitrogen cycling.

Vegetation is represented as a mixture of plant functional types (PFTs) that represent the globally most abundant growth strategies of woody and herbaceous vegetation. PFTs are distinguished in terms of growth form, phenology, life history strategy, allometry, photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4), climate-dependent scaling of physiological processes and a limited set of bioclimatic limits (Smith-et-al-2014). The model uses climate, [CO2], soil information and nitrogen deposition as input, and plant communities evolve dynamically from growth and competition for light, space and soil resources (water and nitrogen) in response to these drivers. LPJ-GUESS also includes a detailed representation of land-use change dynamics together with a crop module (Lindeskog-et-al-2013). In the crop module for global-scale applications, the dominant crop types, such as wheat, maize and rice are represented as crop PFTs, which differ amongst others in management-related parameters such as baseline sowing and harvest dates. Sowing and harvest decisions are modelled based on climate variability and climatic thresholds (Lindeskog-et-al-2013). Irrigation, residue removal after harvest and cover crops between the main growing-seasons, are further management options available in the model. Whereas for other managed land-uses (pasture and urban land-use) and peatland two herbaceous species, one each conforming to the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways, are simulated.
