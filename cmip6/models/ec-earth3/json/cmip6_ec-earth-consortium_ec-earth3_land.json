On the other hand, in CMIP6 the surface albedo (including shading effect of high vegetation), surface roughness length and soil water exploitable by roots for evapotranspiration also do vary following the variability of the effective vegetation cover. Vegetation density is parameterized according to the Lambert Beer law of extinction of light under a vegetation canopy and is therefore allowed to change as a function of Leaf Area Index (LAI) for both low and high vegetation as described in Alessandri-et-al-2017. The surface albedo (including shading effect of high vegetation), surface roughness length and soil water exploitable by roots for evapotranspiration also do vary following the variability of the effective vegetation cover. Time-dependent albedo for each grid-point is represented by a scheme that computes the total surface albedo (Atot) as a weighted combination of contributions from low and high vegetation albedo (Aveglow,high) plus a background time-constant soil albedo (Asoil)."

The numerical approach used in HTESSEL allows that the feedback of skin temperature on net radiation and ground heat flux is included. Up to six different land surface tiles are considered over each grid point: bare ground, low and high vegetation, intercepted water by vegetation, and shaded and exposed snow. The input radiation and reference atmospheric temperature, specific humidity and wind speed are identical for each tile. The surface fluxes seen by the atmosphere are calculated as an area-weighted average over the tiles.
